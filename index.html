                    <p class="lead">The bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass, is the lowest-pitched member of the
                        guitar family.</p>
                    <p>It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an
                        acoustic guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or
                        courses.</p>
                    <p>Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music.</p>
                    <p>The four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches
                        one octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (typically E, A, D, and G). It
                        is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or with a pick.</p>
                    <p>To be heard at normal performance volumes, electric basses require external amplification.</p>

                    <h2 class="p-5">Bass guitar terminology</h2>
                    <p class="lead">According to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, an "Electric bass
                        guitar [is] a guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E1'–A1'–D2–G2.</p>
                    <p>It also defines bass as "Bass (iv). A contraction of Double bass or Electric bass guitar."</p>
                    <p>According to some authors the proper term is "electric bass". Common names for the instrument are
                        "bass guitar", "electric bass guitar", and "electric bass"</p>
                    <h3 class="pt-5">Scale</h3>
                    <p>The scale of the bass is located along the length of the string and forms what is known as the
                        fingerboard.</p>
                    <p>The scale can range in length but is traditionally 34-35 inches long while "short scale" bass
                        guitars are usually between 30-32 inches.</p>
                    <h3 class="pt-5">Pickup</h3>
                    <p>Bass pickups are generally attached to the body of the guitar and located beneath the strings.
                    </p>
                    <p>They often come in a black, rectangular shape and are responsible for translating the physical
                        energy from a person plucking the strings, to electrical energy that is sent to an amplifier to
                        create sound.</p>
                    <p>There are several different kinds of bass pickups that exist, such as single-coil, double-coil,
                        split coil, piezo, and optical pickups.</p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 text-center">1930s</h3>
                    <p class="text-center">In the 1930s, musician and inventor Paul Tutmarc of Seattle, Washington,
                        developed the first
                        electric bass guitar in its modern form, a fretted instrument designed to be played
                        horizontally.</p>
                    <h3 class="pt-5 text-center">1950s</h3>
                    <p class="text-center">In the 1950s, Leo Fender and George Fullerton developed the first
                        mass-produced electric bass guitar.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company began producing the
                        Precision Bass, or P-Bass.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The Fender Bass was a revolutionary instrument for gigging musicians. In
                        comparison with the large, heavy upright bass, which had been the main bass instrument in
                        popular music from the early 20th century to the 1940s.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">In 1953, Monk Montgomery became the first bassist to tour with the Fender
                        bass, in Lionel Hampton's postwar big band. Montgomery was also possibly the first to record
                        with
                        the electric bass, on July 2, 1953, with the Art Farmer Septet.</p>
                    <h3 class="pt-5 text-center">1960s</h3>
                    <p class="text-center">With the explosion in popularity of rock music in the 1960s, many more
                        manufacturers began making electric basses, including Yamaha, Teisco and Guyatone.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"> Introduced in 1960, the Fender Jazz Bass, initially known as the "Deluxe
                        Bass", used a body design known as an offset waist which was first seen on the Jazzmaster guitar
                        in an effort to improve comfort while playing seated. The J-bass features two single-coil
                        pickups.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Providing a more "Gibson-scale" instrument, rather than the 34 inches (864
                        mm) Jazz and Precision, Fender produced the Mustang Bass, a 30-inch (762 mm) scale-length
                        instrument.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The Fender VI, a 6 string bass, was tuned one octave lower than standard
                        guitar tuning. It was release in 1961.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">In the late 1960s, eight-string basses, with four octave paired courses
                        (similar to a 12 string guitar), were introduced. The most well known being the Hagström H8.</p>
                    <h3 class="pt-5 text-center">1970s</h3>
                    <p class="text-center">In 1972, Alembic established what became known as "boutique" or "high-end"
                        electric bass guitars.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification
                        and equalization.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">In 1974 Music Man Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, Forrest White and Leo
                        Fender, introduced the StingRay, the first widely produced bass with active (powered)
                        electronics built into the instrument.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">In the mid-1970s, five-string basses, with a very low "B" string, were
                        introduced.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"> In 1975, bassist Anthony Jackson commissioned luthier Carl Thompson to build
                        a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C
                        string.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">1976 saw the UK company Wal begin production of their own range of active
                        basses.</p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 text-center">Fretless bass guitars</h3>
                    <p class="text-center">While electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless
                        bass guitars are used by some players to achieve different tones, as well as playing additional
                        micro tones.</p>
                    <p>The first commercial fretless bass guitar was the Ampeg AUB-1, introduced in 1966.</p>
                    <h3 class="pt-5 text-center">5 string bass guitars</h3>
                    <p class="text-center">The most common type of bass guitar with more than four strings is the
                        five-string bass.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Five-string basses often have a low-B string, extending the instrument's
                        lower range</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Five-string basses are normally tuned B-E-A-D-G.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Less commonly, five-string instruments add a high C-string, extending the
                        higher range.</p>
                    <h3 class="pt-5 text-center">6 string bass guitars</h3>
                    <p class="text-center">Most commonly, six-string basses add a low B and a high C, extending the
                        range on the low end and the higher register, although other tunings are used.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Six-string basses are normally tuned B0–E1–A1–D2–G2–C3</p>
